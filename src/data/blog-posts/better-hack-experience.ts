      question: "What was The Better Hack hackathon about?",
      answer: "The Better Hack was a 24-hour hackathon focused on creating innovative solutions for enterprise knowledge management and access. The challenge was to build tools that could help organizations better leverage their institutional knowledge."
    },
    {
      question: "Did you work alone or with a team?",
      answer: "I participated as a solo developer, competing against teams of 3-5 members. While challenging, this allowed me to move quickly and maintain a consistent vision throughout the project."
    },
    {
      question: "What technologies did you use in your winning solution?",
      answer: "I built the AI Knowledge Navigator using Neo4j for the knowledge graph, React for the frontend, and integrated GPT-4 through LangChain for natural language processing. I also used D3.js for the interactive visualizations."
    },
    {
      question: "What was the prize for winning the hackathon?",
      answer: "The prize included $10,000 and a 6-month enterprise partnership opportunity to further develop and potentially commercialize the solution."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I use knowledge graphs in my own projects?",
      answer: "Knowledge graphs are powerful tools for representing complex, interconnected information. I recommend starting with Neo4j, which has excellent documentation and community support. Focus first on defining your domain's key entities and relationships before diving into implementation."
